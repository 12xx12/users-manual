<p>
	Cuberite supports several storage schemas. Note that Cuberite tries to load chunks from all storage schemas, no matter what this setting is set to. But only the storage set here will be used for saving chunks. This means that a world can be primed with MCA files from a Notchian server and still use the Compact schema for saving.

<h4>Available Options</h4>

<figure>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Variable</th>
		<th>Meaning</th>
		<th>Default</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Schema</td>
		<td>Schema used for saving chunks. May be one of "Default", "Compact", "Anvil" and "Forgetful". See table below for their description.</td>
		<td>Default</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CompressionFactor</td>
		<td>How much the world files should be compressed. Lower values mean much larger file sizes, but slighly increased performance, and higher values mean slightly smaller file sizes and much lower performance. It is recommended just to keep with the default.</td>
		<td>6</td>

<h4>Schema Options</h4>

<figure>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Schema</th>
		<th>File Type</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Default</td>
		<td>.mca</td>
		<td>This is just an alias for Anvil at the moment.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Anvil</td>
		<td>.mca</td>
		<td>Storage is compatible with other Minecraft-related tools and programs. MCA files are stored in the "region" subfolder of the world folder, and a "level.dat" file is generated inside the world folder.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Compact</td>
		<td>.pak</td>
		<td>Native Cuberite schema that takes up a bit less space than Anvil and generally loads and saves a tiny bit faster. This schema is also cached, so it performs less Disk IO operations than Anvil (but takes up more RAM)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Forgetful</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
		<td>Doesn't save chunks. Changes to the world are lost as soon as the chunks are unloaded, making this useful for read-only public servers. Please note that Cuberite will still load chunks using other schemas.</td>
	</tr>
