	Pre-compiled builds are faster to install  and easier to use than compiling your own, and are recommended for beginners.
	However, if you have hardware for which no pre-compiled build exists it may be neccessary to compile yourself. Compiling yourself also has a significant performance advantage on modern machines. If you know how to use the command line or want extra speed you should {{1.2 - compile MCServer yourself}}.

	On Linux, you can use this command to install MCServer:<br>
	<pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc-server/MCServer/master/easyinstall.sh | sh</code></pre>

	The main download location for builds is the <a href="http://mc-server.org">official homepage</a>, with the latest builds available. For developers who want more control over the builds they download, they should visit the <a href="http://builds.cuberite.org">buildserver</a>.
