	Pre-compiled builds are faster to install and easier to use than compiling your own, and are recommended for beginners.
	However, if you have hardware for which no pre-compiled build exists it may be neccessary to compile yourself. Compiling yourself also has a significant performance advantage on modern machines. If you know how to use the command line or want extra speed you should {{1.2 - compile Cuberite yourself}}.
</p>

<p>
	On Linux, simply paste this command into your terminal to install Cuberite:
</p>

<figure class="codebox"><pre><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuberite/cuberite/master/easyinstall.sh | sh</code></pre></figure>

<p id="buildsurl">
	For Windows or Mac builds, the main download location is the <a href="http://cuberite.org">official homepage</a>, with the latest builds available. For developers who want more control over the builds they download, they should visit the <a href="http://builds.cuberite.org">buildserver</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have downloaded the pre-compiled builds, you can skip straight to {{1.3 - Running Cuberite}}.
