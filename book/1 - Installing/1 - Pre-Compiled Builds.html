	Pre-compiled builds are faster and easier to use than compiling your own, and are recommended for beginners.
	However, they can be slower and may not be available for unusual hardware. If you know the command line or 
	want extra speed you should {{1.2 - compile MCServer yourself}}.

<h4 id="prebuiltlinux">Linux (incl RasPi)</h4>

<p>
	Linux builds are available from the <a href="http://ci.bearbin.net">Bearbin CI Server</a> as tar archives. They simply need to be extracted, and MCServer can be run. Make sure to choose the right option between 32 and 64 bits (if you're not sure, choose 32 bit as it works on both 64 bit and 32 bit machines). If you're using a Raspberry Pi, make sure to choose the correct option between hard and soft float (if you're not sure which to choose, hard float is probably right).
