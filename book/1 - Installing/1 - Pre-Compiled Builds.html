	Pre-compiled builds are faster and easier to use than compiling your own, and are recommended for beginners.
	However, they can be more than twice as slow as a self-compiled build and they may not be available for unusual hardware. If you know the command line or want extra speed you should {{1.2 - compile MCServer yourself}}.

	Pre-compiled builds can be downloaded from the <a href="http://mc-server.org/builds.html">official builds page</a>. For developers who want more control over the builds they download, they should visit the <a href="http://bronze.bearbin.net">buildserver</a>.
