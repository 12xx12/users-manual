	Compiling yourself takes longer and is more involved, but on modern processors can lead to a speed increase of up to 1.5 to 3x.

<aside class="warnbox">
	Warning: This process requires use of the command line. If you are not familiar with it, it is recommended that you use the {{1.1 - pre-compiled builds}} instead.

<h4 id="compilinglinux">Linux/Mac/BSD</h4>

<p>
	Compiling on Linux and related operating systems is easy and simple, although it does require some tools before you can get started. You need a C++ compiler (Clang++ or G++), a C compiler (Clang or GCC), Git, CMake and Make. A simple command to make sure these tools are installed (Ubuntu/Debian) is:
</b>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install clang git cmake build-essential</code></pre>

<p>
	Once the tools are installed, you should clone the Git repo:
</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer.git
cd MCServer
git submodule update --init
</code></pre>

<p>
	You should then run the CMake process and compile:
</p>

<pre><code>cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
make . -j 2</code></pre>

<aside class="warnbox">
	This step may take longer on slow hardware like Raspberry Pis, up to several hours in some cases. However, subsequent compiles will be faster.

	For a more detailed look at Build Flags and their utility (especially if you are compiling a build on a different machine than the one your are running it on), see <a href="#buildflags">below</a>.
</aside>

<p>
	Once the compilation process is finished, the MCServer executable will be placed inside the <code>MCServer</code> inside the repository that you downloaded. You can copy this folder anywhere you like, just make sure to copy the supporting files otherwise the server will not work properly.

<h4 id="buildflags">Build Flags</h4>

<p>
	MCServer's build process supports a large number of flags for customising the builds. This section documents there meanings.
	Use these flags by adding <code>-DFlag_name=Value</code> to the cmake configuration command. For example to enable test 
	generation using the <code>SELF_TEST</code> flag add: <code>-DSELF_TEST=ON</code>
<p>

<dl>
	<dt>BUILD_TOOLS</dt>
	<dd>
		Adds the MCServer tools to the build. At the moment only MCADefrag and ProtoProxy are added. Define as <code>ON</code> to
		enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
	</dd>
	<dt>BUILD_UNSTABLE_TOOLS</dt>
	<dd>
		Adds tools that are not working yet to the build. Currently is only Generator Performance Test. Used for developing these
		tools. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
	</dd>
	<dt>SELF_TEST</dt>
	<dd>
		Enables generation of tests and self-test startup code. Tests can be run with <code>ctest</code> and with makefiles 
		<code>make test</code>. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
	</dd>
	<dt>FORCE_32</dt>
	<dd>
		Forces the build to use 32 bit builds on *nix systems. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to
		disable.
	</dd>
	<dt>CROSSCOMPILE</dt>
	<dd>
		Disables optimizations for the build host. This is important when building on a different machine from the one you will
		run MCServer on as the build machine may support instructions the final machine does not. This flag only has any effect
		on linux. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
	</dd>
