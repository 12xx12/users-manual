<p>
  MCServer's build process supports a large number of flags for customising the builds. This section documents there meanings.
  Use these flags by adding <code>-DFlag_name=Value</code> to the cmake configuration command. For example to enable test 
  generation using the <code>SELF_TEST</code> flag add: <code>-DSELF_TEST=ON</code>
<p>

<dl>
  <dt>BUILD_TOOLS</dt>
  <dd>
    Adds the MCServer tools to the build. At the moment only MCADefrag and ProtoProxy are added. Define as <code>ON</code> to
    enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
  </dd>
  <dt>BUILD_UNSTABLE_TOOLS</dt>
  <dd>
    Adds tools that are not working yet to the build. Currently is only Generator Performance Test. Used for developing these
    tools. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
  </dd>
  <dt>SELF_TEST</dt>
  <dd>
    Enables generation of tests and self-test startup code. Tests can be run with <code>ctest</code> and with makefiles 
    <code>make test</code>. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
  </dd>
  <dt>FORCE_32</dt>
  <dd>
    Forces the build to use 32 bit builds on *nix systems. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to
    disable.
  </dd>
  <dt>CROSSCOMPILE</dt>
  <dd>
    Disables optimizations for the build host. This is important when building on a different machine from the one you will
    run MCServer on as the build machine may support instructions the final machine does not. This flag only has any effect
    on linux. Define as <code>ON</code> to enable. Define as <code>OFF</code> to disable.
  </dd>
