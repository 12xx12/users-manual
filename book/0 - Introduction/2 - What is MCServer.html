	MCServer is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Minecraft Server. MCServer is designed with performance, configurability, and extensibility in mind, and also aims to accurately recreate most vanilla features.  MCServer is written in C++, and there is also an expansive plugin system that allows for the user to write their own plugins with Lua. In fact, many of the built in commands are implemented by the Core plugin, which has it's own <a href="https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer">GitHub repository</a> and developer community. For more information on the plugin system and how to use it, as well as how to develop for it, please see section XXXXX &lt;- Insert section there.

	MCServer today is maintained by a large team of <a href="https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS">open-source contributors</a> and plugin developers.
