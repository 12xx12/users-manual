	MCServer is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Minecraft Server. MCServer has been designed to keep in consideration performance, configurability and extensibility, as well as to replicate many vanilla features. MCServer is written in C++, although there is an expansive plugin system utilising Lua. In fact, many of the built in commands are implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/mc-server/Core">Core</a> plugin, which has it's own <a href="https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer">GitHub repository</a> and developer community.

	MCServer today is maintained by a large team of <a href="https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS">open-source contributors</a> and plugin developers. If you want to reward the developers for their work, you can set up a donation on <a href="https://gittip.com/mcs_team">Gittip</a> or <a href="http://tip4commit.com/projects/74">Tip4Commit</a> (using bitcoin).
