    <td>MaxChunkRAM</td>
    <td>
	The (soft) maximum amount of RAM which can be used by chunk data. 
	Increasing this improves performance but consumes more RAM.
	Note that this is a rough estimation. In reality the chunk data will consume more than the specified amount.
	If too many players are online, this setting is ignored, and Cuberite will resort to saving and/or unloading chunks
	as soon as players leave them.

  <tr>
    <td>MinimizeRAM</td>
    <td>
	If set to 1, Cuberite will strive to not reach MaxChunkRAM. This is achieved by unloading clean chunks as soon
	as players leave them, and by saving and then unloading dirty chunks if MaxChunkRAM is ever reached.<br/>
	If set to 0, Cuberite will use all the RAM specified in MaxChunkRAM as a chunk cache. This significantly 
	improves performance, Cuberite will constantly use the entirety of the amount specified in MaxChunkRAM.
	This is done by unloading or saving as few chunks as possible. 0 is recommended for dedicated servers.
	Note that in both cases, all chunks are saved at least once every 5 minutes to prevent data loss.
