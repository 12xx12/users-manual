	You can link worlds without resorting to plugins by modifying <code>world.ini</code> files.
	However, this method is limited: Each world can only be linked to 2 different worlds.

<p>
	By default, stepping through any Nether Portal leads to the Nether, and stepping through any End Portal leads to the End.
	This behavior can be tweaked, and you can make these portals teleport to a world of your choice. This is done by editing
	the <code>[LinkedWorlds]</code> section of each world's <code>world.ini</code> file.
	Note that with this method, you can't make two different portals of the same type teleport you to two different worlds.
	If you want such behavior, use a plugin and read the previous subsection.
