<p>
	Cuberite supports multiple worlds. Each world has its own `world.ini` file. Additional Worlds can be added by editing <code>settings.ini</code>. This is explained in the example below.
</p>

<figure class="codebox">
<pre><code>[Worlds]
DefaultWorld=world
World=myNewWorld
World=HappyLand
</code></pre>
</figure>

<p>
	In the example above, 2 extra worlds are added to the server. Note that this automatically creates 2 additional configuration files, namely <code>myNewWorld/world.ini</code> and <code>HappyLand/world.ini</code>.
</p>

<p>
	The rest of this section deals with linking worlds and travelling between them.
